        Many new traders open a chart full of indicators, colors, and news headlines and quickly feel overwhelmed. 
        This guide explains, in simple steps, how beginners can track the stock market without confusion using a clean workspace, 
        a few trusted indicators, and a structured daily routine.
      </p>
      <p>
        By following the process below, you can transform random chart watching into a repeatable workflow that helps you make 
        better decisions and avoid emotional trades.

      <h2>1. Start with a Clean Trading Workspace</h2>
      <p>
        The biggest mistake beginners make is adding too many indicators to the chart. 
        A clean workspace helps you focus on price and trend instead of noise.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select a single platform for your charts, such as TradingView, and keep the same layout every day.</li>
        <li>Use candlestick charts with a neutral background so that price action is easy to read.</li>
        <li>Track only a short watchlist at first, like the main index, one currency pair, and a commodity such as gold.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
        Pro tip: In ApexTicker you can pin your top five indices and see them in one dashboard, then open detailed charts only when something moves.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Use Only Two or Three Core Indicators</h2>
      <p>
        Indicators should confirm what you already see on the chart, not replace your thinking. 
        For beginners, it is usually enough to combine a trend indicator with a momentum or strength indicator.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Moving Averages (MA):</strong> Use a 50-period and 200-period moving average to see the overall direction of the market.</li>
        <li><strong>Relative Strength Index (RSI):</strong> Helps you notice when price may be overbought or oversold.</li>
        <li><strong>Volume:</strong> Confirms whether big players are active when price breaks important levels.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These tools are easy to add in most charting platforms and give enough information for simple swing and position trades.
