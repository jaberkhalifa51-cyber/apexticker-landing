        Many new traders open a chart full of indicators, colors, and news headlines and quickly feel overwhelmed. 
        This guide explains, in simple steps, how beginners can track the stock market without confusion using a clean workspace, 
        a few trusted indicators, and a structured daily routine.
      </p>
      <p>
        By following the process below, you can transform random chart watching into a repeatable workflow that helps you make 
        better decisions and avoid emotional trades.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Start with a Clean Trading Workspace</h2>
      <p>
        The biggest mistake beginners make is adding too many indicators to the chart. 
        A clean workspace helps you focus on price and trend instead of noise.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select a single platform for your charts, such as TradingView, and keep the same layout every day.</li>
        <li>Use candlestick charts with a neutral background so that price action is easy to read.</li>
        <li>Track only a short watchlist at first, like the main index, one currency pair, and a commodity such as gold.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="note">
        Pro tip: In ApexTicker you can pin your top five indices and see them in one dashboard, then open detailed charts only when something moves.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Use Only Two or Three Core Indicators</h2>
      <p>
        Indicators should confirm what you already see on the chart, not replace your thinking. 
        For beginners, it is usually enough to combine a trend indicator with a momentum or strength indicator.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Moving Averages (MA):</strong> Use a 50-period and 200-period moving average to see the overall direction of the market.</li>
        <li><strong>Relative Strength Index (RSI):</strong> Helps you notice when price may be overbought or oversold.</li>
        <li><strong>Volume:</strong> Confirms whether big players are active when price breaks important levels.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These tools are easy to add in most charting platforms and give enough information for simple swing and position trades.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Build a Daily
      <h2>3. Build a Daily Routine</h2>
      <p>
        Consistency is key. Instead of staring at the screen all day, follow this simple 30-minute routine:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pre-market (15 mins):</strong> Check the economic calendar on ApexTicker to see if any big news is coming (like CPI or Jobs Report).</li>
        <li><strong>Market Open (15 mins):</strong> Watch the first 15 minutes of price action but do not trade immediately. Let the initial volatility settle.</li>
        <li><strong>End of Day:</strong> Review your watchlist. Did price close above the 50-day Moving Average? If yes, the trend is still up.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Stop Loss is Your Best Friend</h2>
      <p>
        Never enter a trade without knowing where you will exit if you are wrong. 
        A common rule for beginners is the "2% Rule": never risk more than 2% of your total account on a single trade.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Tracking the stock market doesn't have to be complicated. By keeping your charts clean, using just a few key indicators, 
        and sticking to a routine, you can trade with clarity.
