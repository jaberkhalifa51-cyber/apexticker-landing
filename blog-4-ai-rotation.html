        <div class="article-intro">
            <strong>Quick Summary:</strong> After a year of absolute dominance by artificial intelligence stocks in American stock market indices, investors are beginning to realize that the "AI party" is over. Now they're turning toward small-cap stocks (Russell 2000), healthcare sectors, and traditional companies. This shift isn't just a minor correction—it's a real inflection point in investment strategy.
        </div>

        <div class="article-content">
            <p>
                At the beginning of this year, the picture was crystal clear: any stock carrying the words "artificial intelligence" or "AI" in its description was climbing with ease. Investing in mega-cap technology was like placing the only bet you couldn't lose. But in December 2025, the scene has changed completely.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>Current Reality:</strong> Between November 20 and now, the Russell 2000 small-cap index achieved growth of 9.4%, setting a new all-time record. The broader S&P 500 index delivered only 5.1% during the same period. The message is crystal clear: money has begun moving away from technology giants.

            <h2 class="section-title">What Changed the Game?</h2>

            <p>
                Well, no single dramatic event occurred. Rather, a collection of things began unfolding slowly, raising serious doubts among investors:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-content">
                <li><strong>Insane Capital Costs:</strong> AI companies (especially in GPU and server segments) require massive investments. We're talking about billions annually. And profitability? Still nowhere on the horizon in many cases.</li>
                <li><strong>Competition Intensifies Rapidly:</strong> There's no longer a "secured advantage" for any single AI company. Everyone's developing similar models. ChatGPT isn't alone anymore. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and even Meta are in the race.</li>
                <li><strong>Valuations Have Become Unrealistic:</strong> Some tech stocks were trading at historical multiples with no rational justification. Smart investors started taking their profits.</li>
                <li><strong>Federal Reserve Decision:</strong> Expectations of interest rate cuts benefited small-cap stocks and companies struggling with high debt levels.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="quote">
                "Big tech gave us 17% of the gains, but now we must think about diversification. The real gold might be in places we haven't looked carefully for a long time."

            <h2 class="section-title">Where Is the Money Going Now?</h2>

            <p>
                Investors are currently focusing on three main sectors:
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>1️⃣ Small-Cap Stocks (Russell 2000):</strong> These companies were "neglected" all year while everyone chased Tesla, Nvidia, and Microsoft stocks. Now investors are realizing that many of these small companies enjoy strong fundamentals and reasonable valuations.
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>2️⃣ Healthcare Sector:</strong> In November and early 2025, investors began shifting funds to pharmaceutical, clinical, and medical company stocks. These sectors are less volatile and offer regular income streams (dividends).
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>3️⃣ Traditional Companies (Old Economy):</strong> Shipping, energy, commodities, even traditional automakers. Investors recognize these sectors won't suffer from tech bubble fallout.
            </div>

            <h2 class="section-title">What About Cryptocurrencies?</h2>

            <p>
                While the stock market undergoes rebalancing, the cryptocurrency market is moving in a completely different direction. Bitcoin approached $123,500, and Ethereum surged over 30% recently. This signals that investors maintain confidence in digital assets despite stock market uncertainty.
            </p>

            <p>
                The difference is that cryptocurrencies now attract investors anticipating positive Federal Reserve decisions. Lower interest rates + potential inflation = increased demand for Bitcoin.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-title">What Should You Do Now?</h2>

            <div class="warning-box">
                ⚠️ <strong>Important Disclaimer:</strong> This is not financial advice. We're sharing current market perspective with you. Always consult a financial advisor before making investment decisions.
            </div>

            <p>
                If you're tracking the market now (or considering entering it), here's what experts are saying:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-content">
                <li><strong>Diversify Your Portfolio:</strong> Don't put all your money into one technology or sector. Risk distribution is wisdom.</li>
                <li><strong>Search for Value, Not Just Growth:</strong> Companies paying dividend distributions with stable earnings may be the best choice in the coming period.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitor Small-Cap Stocks:</strong> Russell 2000 still has vast room for growth. Not every small stock is famous, but some might be hidden gems.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't Ignore Gold and Commodities:</strong> In uncertain times, traditional assets like gold provide protection.</li>
                <li><strong>Watch Sterling and Canadian Dollar:</strong> Currencies also respond to central bank decisions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-title">The Deeper Story: Is This the End of Tech's Golden Age?</h2>

            <p>
                No. But it's the end of the "madness" era, where any tech stock climbed simply because it existed. Now things are more realistic. Companies with:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-content">
                <li>Clear and profitable business models</li>
                <li>Strong cash flows</li>
                <li>Genuine competitive advantages</li>
                <li>Clear plans for profiting from artificial intelligence</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These companies will continue rising. Others will face significant headwinds.
            </p>

            <div class="article-conclusion">
                <h3>Final Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    2025 hasn't been a bad year for stocks. The S&P 500 is up 17% since the start of the year. But the way this gain happened has changed. It's no longer driven by a small group of mega-cap tech stocks. Instead, the market is broadening. That's a healthy sign of a more balanced market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're looking for opportunities now, the field is wide open. Small-cap stocks, healthcare, energy, even cryptocurrencies... each has a story to tell. The smart investor is the one who reads these stories carefully.
